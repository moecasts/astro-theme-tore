## Introduction

Astro is a modern web framework that helps you build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. It's perfect for content-focused sites like blogs, documentation, and marketing pages.

## Why Astro?

### ðŸš€ Fast by Default

Astro generates static HTML by default, which means your site loads incredibly fast. JavaScript is only loaded when needed.

### ðŸŽ¨ Bring Your Own Framework

Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework you prefer. Astro supports them all!

### ðŸ“¦ Zero JS by Default

Astro ships zero JavaScript by default. Components are rendered to HTML at build time.

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. You can choose from various templates or start from scratch.

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project looks like this:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Creating Your First Page

Create a new file in `src/pages/about.astro`:

```astro
---
const pageTitle = "About Me";
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{pageTitle}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Astro site!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

Astro is a powerful tool for building modern websites. Its focus on performance and developer experience makes it an excellent choice for your next project.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
